Sierpiński triangle, also called the Sierpinski gasket or Sierpinski sieve, is a fractal and attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles.

For the first two examples, I am using processing. To learn more about this Java based language and software, go to: https://processing.org/

This last example, I made it using JavaScript and the p5.js library. To learn more about the p5.js library, go to: https://p5js.org/
