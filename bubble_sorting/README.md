# bubble_sorting
### In This project I made a visual representation of bubble sorting ###

For this first example, I am using processing. To learn more about this Java based language and software, go to: https://processing.org/



Output will go from:
![visual representation of bubble sorting](./bubbleMovie/bubble_0001.png)



to: 
![visual representation of bubble sorting](./bubbleMovie/bubble_0276.png)



the actual vid should look like:
